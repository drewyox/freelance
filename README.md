## User Stories

* _New User, who is not affiliated with a tech company:_
* _Needs: Wants to learn as much as possible through a quick glance at the site. They're looking for space for their new project, and want to know if they'll be a good match personality wise as well._
* _Pain Points: Other spaces seemed to exclusively Tech-y, didn't have features (as far as the physical space goes) highlighted in their websites._
* _How Can We Serve?: Make the site clearly state information with intuitive navigation between them. Emphasize the funky yet approachable style through design._

* _Established User:_
* _Needs: Wants to stay updated with any new events or updates to the workspace. Wants to engage in workspace culture._
* _Pain Points: Doesn't want to be bogged down by continually being asked to join their site if they are already a member._
* _How Can We Serve?: Include a login so returning users can both avoid constant prompts for joining, and contribute to the site either through events._
